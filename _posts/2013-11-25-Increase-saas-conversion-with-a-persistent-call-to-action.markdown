Most SaaS companies generate a majority (if not all) of their leads through their marketing sites, and if the site is well designed there is a single and clear call to action. That call to action (most typically a button but sometimes a form or a video) is extremely important and a lot of attention is typically given to it on the front page, but it is also very important that you have a persistent call to action across your site. I often see marketing sites that have a clear and well designed call to action on their front page, but have no call to action on any of the other pages. By forcing your siteâ€™s visitors to return to the front page in order to convert you are putting up an unnecessary roadblock and almost certainly hurting your conversion rate. Below are a couple examples of marketing sites with a well designed and persistent call to action:

<a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>

A persistent header with a clear call to action.

<a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/features" target="_blank">Kissmetrics</a>

Simple sign up form that is in the same place on every page of the site.

<a href="http://www.marketo.com/customers/" target="_blank">Marketo</a>

Marketo has three call to actions but they are persistent across the site.

If your SaaS site currently only has a call to action on your front page, take a look at your analytics and see what other pages your users most often visit before converting. Then as a simple experiment try putting a call to action on those most frequently visited pages and see how many conversions you get from them. If they are resulting in a significant amount of conversions then you may want to consider a redesign that includes a persistent call to action like one of the examples above.
