Product management, which is the process of defining a product’s goals, success criteria, and vision, involves some really valuable functions and skills that I think could help us solve some of the above. 

I worked as a product manager for about a year and have done a lot of reading on the the practice but am by no means an expert. Anyway based on my experience here is how I define the core functions and skills involved.

Functions:

-product discovery (talk to customers, do research, define the problem the product will solve and the goals)

-product definition (define what the product is, how it will accomplish the goals, and how to measure success)

 

Skills:

-assessing opportunities

-defining product principles

-creating a product vision/story

-prototyping and testing

-customer empathy

-analyzing product data

 

Our team is amazing at implementing solutions and I think that learning and applying product management skills could make us significantly better at defining the best solution to meet our goals.

If your curious to read more about product management Marty Cagan’s "Inspired: How To Create Products Customers Love” is the definitive work and I highly recommend it. Here is a couple shorter articles by him that are also really insightful:
