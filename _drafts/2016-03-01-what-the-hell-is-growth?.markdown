‘Growth’ is the birth child of smart tech companies that realized something needs to exist between marketing and product. ‘Isn't that product marketing?’ you might ask? No, not really. Traditional product marketing in software includes things like go-to-market strategies, messaging, and often some business development with partners. Growth is not so narrowly defined. Growth is a systematic process of driving key usage metrics for your business. Let’s break this down. Notice I said ‘key usage metrics’ and not just key metrics. Key metrics could include anything within your company, for example number of engineers hired. Growth is concerned specifically with metrics related to the usage of your product. These could include things like monthly sign ups, revenue per user, life time value, etc.

The other important part is that growth is responsible for building a systematic process. There’s a common misconception, due to the popularity of the ‘growth hacker’ title, that growth involves a series of ‘hacks’, or clever tricks, that drive the use of a product. It usually is possible for someone to step in to a growth role at a young startup and get some big wins with these hacks in the first few months, but this is almost never sustainable. 

The way a growth team is allowed to go about accomplishing it’s goals vary from company to company, but in most successful, high growth companies they are 

A growth team should be driven by a single goal, and that goal should be a number. Pretty much all companies have more than one number that they care about and it’s very tempting for those in charge to give a growth team multiple goals, but in my experience this makes it much more likely the team will lose focus and not accomplish it’s goals. 

A better approach is to give a single number with other numbers that should not be adversely effected. The first word in the goal should almost always be ‘grow’. For example, ‘grow monthly recurring revenue to $1,000,000 without adversely affecting the current churn rate’. Now this seems harmless, but you’re now incentivizing behavior that not does two different things. There are cases when churn can be high but revenue can still be growing very fast, for example if small accounts are churning while those that stay are upgrading in to the very high paying accounts.

A growth hacker will tend to be very analytical, focusing almost solely on numbers and rarely having in depth conversations with customers or collecting qualitiateive data. A product manager, while of course relying on data for many decisions, much also have extensive conversations with customers and rely on data collected from these conversations in order to make product decisions.
