I worked at CircleCI for about a year and half, and for the first 8 months it was a completely flat organization with no managers or hierarchy. The 'flatness' was one of the things that made working here one of the most interesting experiences of my professional life. Companies with 'flat' cultures come in all shapes and sizes, so here is a little background on how things worked during CircleCI's experiment with flatness. 

Is there really no hierarchy?

Kinda. The only explicit hierarchy that existed was between founders and non-founders, and even this was kept mostly to a minimum. The founders (there were two at first and eventually just one) did have certain inherent responsibilities and powers that the rest of the company did not (final say on firing decisions and compensation, for example), but most decisions were made as a group. Those who had more experience in a particular realm or had been with the company longer tended to have more influence, but that is due to informal social norms, not something that is institutionalized by the company. There are no bosses and no one has someone to report to or take orders from.



How does hiring work?

We hired as a group and by consensus. Once a candidate, made it to the end of the hiring funnel (this was made up a pretty rigoroues set of interview) we meet as a group and all gave our feedback on the candidate, along with a score from 1-4. Sometimes the  decision would be obvious from this feedback, and sometimes further discussion and debate was needed. Only twice during our flatness the company was completely split on a candidate. We ended up going with the founder/CEO's decision in this case.

 
There are a lot of other good questions that we have ideas on but are still experimenting to find the best solution. Those include:

How are raises determined?
This was one that was never really determined before we switched to having something more similar to a traditional corporate structure. 

Does flat work better for engineering than the rest of the company? And can flat teams live side-by-side non-flat ones?

How does project and product management work? What is the structure and process for large, complex projects?

 
 

When I was first interviewing and discussing joining Circle, I was intrigued by the idea of a flat company, but skeptical of it working in practice. After 6-months I've shifted a bit more towards being a believer in flat, but I'm still somewhat skeptical that we will be able to scale with.

By far the coolest thing about working in a flat company for me has been the breadth of experience I've gained in a short amount of time. These are just a few of the things I've worked on or been involved with in the last 6 month:

hiring
content (writing, strategizing, editing)
strategy
writing code
running tests
experimenting with multiple paid and non-paid acquisition channels
evaluating and completing an acquisition
writing press releases for company milestones
changing our pricing structure
taking sales calls
doing customer support
representing the company at conferences
 

The Good:

It helps attract talent. 

Many people love the allure of working for a company with no managers. Many developers value the freedom to be involved in multiple aspects of the company and to work on what they think is the most important/interesting project.

It often leads to better decisions. 

When you have a team of smart people, and rely of them to make decisions as a group, they often make very good decisions. There are definitely draw backs to this process as well though (see below).

 

It makes the team more agile adaptable


The Bad:

It takes a lot more work building the organization.

Unlike a more tradition, hierarchical management structure, flat is not well established or time-tested. It takes a lot more time and effort to make flat work.

A lot more is required of your employees.

It could be argues that this is an advantage, but I'm arguing the other way here. Because every member of the company has a say in making big decisions, everyone has to be up speed on what is going on ((needs work))

It can take longer to make decisions.

In a traditional organization, a higher-up will make a decision, and then others will execute on it. In a flat company, these decisions are made a group, and if consensus cannot be reached the result is often that nothing gets done. In my opinion this is by far the biggest drawback to flat.

 

The Ugly

The truth is that no matter how hard you want to be 'flat', there are always implied hierarchies that are nearly impossible to overcome. An employee will rarely go directly against the wishes of a founder, a new employee will likely usually defer to a more tenured employee when there is a stalemate, and someone with 2 years of experience will often
